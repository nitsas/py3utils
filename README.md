py3utils
========

Some simple, and hopefully useful, Python 3 utilities.

Some of them might also work for Python 2. I have currently included no 
indication as to which ones do work for Python 2.

Included Utilities
------------------

- rot13
    + Convert a string to ROT13 and back.
    + Usage: 
        ```python
        rot13(text)
        ```
